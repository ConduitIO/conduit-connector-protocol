# Conduit Plugin

:warning: WORK IN PROGRESS :warning:

This repository contains the definition of the Conduit plugin. It is a thin layer that hides the gRPC implementation
details without adding any functionality on top. This is NOT the plugin SDK.

This repository is the only connection point between Conduit and one of its plugins.
